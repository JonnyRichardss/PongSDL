# PongSDL

Basic pong clone built with code from my SDL engine:

This is the version that runs on a windows PC - the PS2 version relies on specialised input handling due to some SDL bugs
I am currently having trouble with GitHub Releases so the Release.zip is just included in the root of the source files
